 * [Installation](#installation)
 * [Creating a Sandbox environment](#creating-a-sandbox-environment)

## Installation

The following instructions outline installation using Composer. If you don't
have Composer, you can download it from [http://getcomposer.org/](http://getcomposer.org/)

 * Run either of the following commands, depending on your environment:

```
$ composer require "danrevah/sandboxbundle":"1.0.*" 
$ php composer.phar require "danrevah/sandboxbundle":"1.0.*"
```


## Creating a Sandbox environment

1. Copy the file from your `project-root-directory/web/app_dev.php` and call the new file `app_sandbox.php`.
2. In the `app_sandbox.php` file change `$kernel = new AppKernel('dev', true);` to `$kernel = new AppKernel('sandbox', true);`
3. Copy the file from your `project-root-directory/app/config_dev.yml` and call it `config_sandbox.yml`.
4. Go to `project-root-directory/app/AppKernel.php` and change this line `in_array($this->getEnvironment(), array('dev', 'test')` to `in_array($this->getEnvironment(), array('dev', 'test', 'sandbox')`.
5. In the AppKernel.php file after the if case you've just edited add this case also
```php
    if (in_array($this->getEnvironment(), array('sandbox'))) {
        $bundles[] = new danrevah\SandboxBundle\SandboxBundle();
    }
```
6. Copy the file from `project-root-directory/app/config/config_dev.yml` and call it `config_sandbox.yml`.
7. Add this to your `config_sandbox.yml`
```yml
    sandbox:
      response:
        force: true # Force mode means you won't be able to fall to the REAL controller if path's annotation not found.
```
8. That's it! you can now access your sandbox environment using `app_sandbox.php`
